# M29 round 2: agent playtests on the live storyteller (DRAFT)

Round 2 (2026-10-23), after M29.5a-c and M29.6b, live DeepSeek. Personas: #4 rogue-heavy (Sonnet, full campaign),
full playthrough classic four (Sonnet), #5 solo careful (Haiku, acts 1-2), #7 economy duo (Haiku, acts 1-2),
#8 all casters (Haiku, acts 1-2). Saves: saves/playtests/r2-*/saves (gitignored). Reports came back as text; the main
session checked each bug against its save before listing it here.
Spend: logs/llm.jsonl had 1464 lines before round 2 (total filled in when the round ends).

## Harness problems (scripts/agent only)
- H7 `trade` reads the `shop_stock` message right after the turn settles and does not wait for it; on the live
  storyteller the stock arrives late, so the first trade after arriving says "The shop did not open (no vote?)" although
  the engine opened the shop (p5 events 327-328, 713). `open_stock` must wait for the stock message.
- H8 `do attack` without an option picks the attack with the best hit chance only (`Link.best_option`), so a fighter
  with Archery always fires the crossbow, even with the foe in its zone (p5 549-640). Weigh expected damage.
- H9 Display: every turn line shows `attacks_left=0` at the start of a turn; Action Surge is listed as "(spent or
  unavailable)" until the action is spent; the region milestone XP line is unlabelled.

## Game findings (each fix needs a `test_m29_<slug>`)
| id | what | where (run / event) | severity | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | A quest step's text does not match its node: the "clear Gallowroot Copse" step reads "Snuff the bone-pyre the acolytes are stoking" while the copse fields stirge/goblin; a "learn" step tagged ashmede completes from an earlier ashmede fact ("met by what the party has already done") | p5 2 (plan), 243-244; also 453, 498 | medium: story coherence | open |
| R2 | Routed travel stops one node short (Mothfen Hollow, a quest ask), but the narration tells arrival at The False Hearth and records three facts placing the hero there | p5 682-691 | medium: honest storyteller (place) | open |
| R3 | A ranged weapon attack against a foe in the attacker's own zone has no disadvantage (SRD 5.1 "Ranged Attacks in Close Combat"; BG3 Threatened); the crossbow is always the better pick in melee | p5 549-640 | medium: rules gap | open |
| R4 | A typed Persuasion check that passed (20 vs 20) while an encounter offer was pending did not count for the parley; the parley then rolled again and failed | p5 539, 547 | medium: confusing | open |
| R5 | Narration names a weapon the attacker does not carry (sickle for a scimitar); G7's check only flags a different weapon the attacker carries | p5 75, 88 | low | open |
| R6 | Selling a 1 gp item (hammer, rope, incense) is refused as "not worth buying (shop_worthless)"; the line reads as "this is junk" rather than "worth under 1 gp to this trader" | p5 720-726 | low: wording | open |

## Balance notes
### #5 solo careful (Haiku), save r2-p5-solo c-20261023-150919-0001
108 commands, 8 fights all won, stopped at the act-3 border alive at level 4 (36/36 HP, 69 gp).
- Levels on target: level 2 at the act-1 master, level 3 at the act-2 master.
- Act-1 master (Candle-Mother Adra, "easy", 9 HP for one level-2 hero) died in two hits under a surprise: a warm-up,
  not a master. Act-2 master (Hearthkeeper Veles, "deadly", 38 HP) took 7 rounds, one 19-damage hit, the hero down
  to 9/28 HP; survived with Second Wind and Action Surge and lucky misses (the sims lose 20 of 25 solo runs here).
- Gold plentiful: trivial act-2 kobolds paid 17-23 gp each, Veles 88 gp; a Potion of Healing was affordable after
  every second fight. Three potions, two poultices, a tonic and two draughts were never used.
